This is a single page app that allows users to alert their friends of when and where they are eating lunch. Users can also see where their friends are currently eating and who else is available to join them.

I wanted to create an app that would enable my friends and I to connect over our plans for lunch and facilitate an easy way of meeting up. This app allowed me to become more familiar with AJAX requests and other tools that increase functionality on one page, like HTML modals and dropdowns.
